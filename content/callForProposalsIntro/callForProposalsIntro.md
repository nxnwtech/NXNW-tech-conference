content: >-
  We are launching the conference with a **Call for Proposals** to ensure the
  highest quality and best selection of speakers. We are looking forward to
  speakers sharing their stories & experiences about successes, failures,
  lessons learned, patterns & practices.  Weâ€™re looking for technical and
  non-technical talks covering a broad range of topics in the Information
  Technology space. As a community conference we are encouraging **everyone from
  senior to newcomers from diverse backgrounds**. 


  Talks can be 30 mins or 10 mins lightening talks. 


  The Call for Proposals will close open in **January 2021**. 


  We've listed suggested themes below and are looking forward to your proposals!
